## About Hyper Forums

Hyper Forums is a web application built on top of Laravel. Currently in development and being used as a training project. Not recommend currently for any production enviroments not because there are any bugs but because I dont' guarantee it.

There is better forum software out there and no reason to use this. It may be fun to install and poke around the source code though.
